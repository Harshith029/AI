# üç¨ Hyderabad AI Traffic Optimization System üö¶

## üî• SUGAR Hackathon Theme Integration
Just like **ants** scout and adaptively choose the best and most comfortable paths to reach **sugar**, our users (the ants) are guided to their destination (sugar) in a way that avoids overcrowding a single route. This **nature-inspired strategy** ensures smoother traffic flow, minimal delays, and a better experience overall.

This analogy ties into the **SUGAR hackathon theme** by treating the destination as the sugar and mimicking how nature finds **optimal solutions** to movement and resource collection problems.

## üß† AI Model Overview
### Model: **LSTM Neural Network**
- Predicts upcoming congestion using temporal patterns
- Inputs: time, area, weather/event proximity, road width, vehicle type, peak windows
- Shape: `(24, 15)` input sequences

### Clustering with `cluster_users()`
- Users are clustered based on **origin, sugar, and travel time**
- Reduces conflict between groups on common paths
- Ensures distributed flow with **multi-path redirection**
- Foundation for avoiding early-stage congestion proactively

---

## üë£ Example User Flow
1. **Input via UI / CLI**
   ```bash
   Enter Start Location: HITEC City
   Enter Sugar: LB Nagar
   Vehicle Type: car
   ```

2. **Backend Process**
   - Fetch congestion history, events, time-based traffic maps
   - Cluster users into route buckets
   - Use AI to predict optimal flow and assign path

3. **AI Output (3 Route Options)**
   - Route 1 (fastest but nearing congestion)
   - Route 2 (slightly longer but stable flow)
   - Route 3 (safest path with least footfall)

4. **Final Display**
   ```
   ‚ñ∂ Route Assigned: Route 3 (Optimized Group Route)
   ETA: 17 mins | Distance: 8.4 km | Congestion Score: 12%
   ```

---

## üö® Emergency Mode Handling
- Ambulance/fire brigade users are auto-flagged
- Routes are assigned dynamically with emergency clearance
- `green_corridor.py` handles:
  - Path prioritization
  - Traffic light override (mock)
  - Real-time updates (future API integration)

```python
if vehicle_type == 'ambulance':
    activate_green_corridor(start, destination)
```

---

## üöè Output Sample - Hyderabad Use Case
```
Start: Kukatpally
Destination: Mehdipatnam

üöó Route 1:
‚ñ∂ Kukatpally ‚Üí Erragadda ‚Üí Mehdipatnam (12.1 km | 28 mins)
Congestion: 37%

üöó Route 2:
‚ñ∂ Kukatpally ‚Üí Ring Road ‚Üí Langar Houz (13.2 km | 25 mins)
Congestion: 24%

üöó Route 3:
‚ñ∂ Kukatpally ‚Üí Yousufguda ‚Üí Masab Tank (11.8 km | 22 mins)
Congestion: 18%
```

### üìä Number of Routes Generated
- Default: **3 routes per user**
- Future: Adaptive route count based on cluster density and prediction confidence

---

## üöß Current Limitations
- ‚ùå Real-time updates not yet active
- ‚ùå Model trained on **synthetic traffic data**, not real city feed
- ‚ùå APIs not integrated with GHMC / Google / HERE Maps
- ‚ùå Frontend not fully linked to backend-AI pipeline

‚ö†Ô∏è **Currently, traffic division is auto-handled by AI models** ‚Äî not manual ‚Äî but they're demo-level and untrained on real Hyderabad behavior.

---

## üåç Expansion & Future Development
- üõ∞Ô∏è Add real-time APIs (Govt + crowd-sourced)
- üîÑ Real-time retraining of LSTM model
- üó∫Ô∏è Heatmap generation for visual analytics
- üìà Predictive rerouting & auto-cluster rebalance
- üáÆüá≥ Expand model coverage from Hyderabad to PAN-India
- ü§ñ Train on **live public datasets**, GPS data & mobile streams
- üß† Improve AI explainability, reroute confidence metrics
- üîß Improve backend-AI-frontend communication and workflows

> üöß **Note**: This project is an early-stage **prototype** designed for demonstration purposes only. While all individual modules (prediction model, clustering, emergency rerouting, etc.) are functional, they remain siloed. Full integration and production-level deployment require:
> - Large-scale real-world datasets (Hyderabad origin ‚Üí PAN India)
> - Continuous training pipelines with active data streams
> - Live map APIs and frontend-AI sync workflows
> - User-friendly dashboards, reliability checks, and more testing

---

üéØ **SUGAR Project Philosophy**
> Just like ants locate and follow efficient paths to sugar while dynamically avoiding congestion, this system intelligently leads users to their destinations using adaptive routing and crowd-aware traffic planning. Nature inspires technology to solve complex flow problems ‚Äî from traffic to data to logistics.
